This is a project for an Android development course. The goal of this application is to replicate the feature 
of a food delivery app.
The **features** of this app are:

- An activity with the restaurants list (composed by image, name, address and minimum order) and the
  possibility to choose to view the items either in a linear layout or in a grid layout
- An activity with the list of the menu offered by that restaurant and the possibility to order food
